### Project Overview
This code uses the gyroscope (L3G4200D) and accelerometer (ADXL345) mounted to the PTU to achieve stabilization in one axis (pitch). This function aims to address various muscle degenerative diseases which have the symptom of trembling. Through countering this we aim to provide such people with a means to complete everyday tasks and thus maintain a normal life.

The system block diagram comes in three major modules as below:

### Module 1 â€“ Interfacing
This initial module aimed to provide seamless connection to everyday users, by providing them with a connection both in software and hardware to the device. Moreover, the use of the buzzer to provide auditory prompts allowed users to best interact with the machine, particularly with no prior understanding of the practise of Mechatronics.
The interaction through software utilised a two way serial communication, which would print information or read from a terminal program PuTTY. This was done through a serial module that operated with an input, a function and a baud rate. Note that in hardware, any calling of serial port 0 must be removed (commented) as it creates interference errors with the interrupts. Also note that varying baud rate must be considered to facilitate correct information parsing.

The second interfacing interaction was in hardware, through the utilisation of the liquid crystal display unit. This was particularly useful to update real time instructions when using the board to drive the circuit (i.e: when the buttons were used in calibration). This was chosen to allow a connection in hardware that would communication throughout operation, if say, the code were used to drive a real-world device that needed to communicate with user. The system was chosen to operate without a cursor or blinking, to prevent the false interpretation of active communication.

Finally, the use of the buzzer through an implemented "music module" allowed both a boot and error noise signal to provide the user with an auditory que on correct use. In particular the boot noise was to signal not to use the hardware until boot had completed (with a complementary boot LCD instruction) and the error noise was leveraged to prevent misuse of the board (i.e physically disrupting the servos to incorrect & harmful positions). This was done through an output compare that triggered the buzzer to operate at different PWM frequencies based on the respective note, and hold for a certain duration. Varying scores for any buzzer sound can be implemented within the module.

Ultimately, these three modules were triggered through a boot/help function that initialised on running the script. Despite this providing no additional features to the system, it housed this module and compartmentalised how the three interfacing systems were used.

#### Best Use
The Serial operates with the following inputs:
Where the BaudRate was set to 156 for our operation, the interface was 1 for hardware and the function was determined based on read/write.
```
SerialInitialise(BaudRate, Interface, Function, String_Pointer)
```

The musicmodule operates with no input with the following command:
```
bootjingle()
```

The LCD module operates with the following inputs:
Where CMD / DATA indicated wether the input was a command function to perform a task (i.e: move to next line) or data to write.
```
writeLCD(String_Pointer, CMD/DATA)
```


### Module 2 - Calibration
This module aims to address the issue of drifting which is inherent in sensors. This module calculates the error offsets for later data cleaning as well as general testing of the hardware. This module includes the calibration procedure prompts given to the user through the liquid crystal display, as well as the calibration calculations itself. 
The calibration begun through a servo calibration, that required button input to move servos on the x or z axis. The dipswitches were used to decipher between the two axis, and the accompanying buttons were then utilised to either move the servo, or store the current location. Note that the servos were programmed to never exceed certain bounds, and an error prompt played if this was forced. Also note that the LCD displayed instructions for use throughout practise, and that impropper dipswitch configuration resulted in the 'config dipswitch' prompt. On storing the required max/min values of the servos, the system would utilise this data to facilitate the bounds through which its gyroscopic correction would occur.

The second calibration device calibrated the sensor data to account for drift. This was done through reading the i^2c device, and determining the offset from a neutral position. Specifically, the system set the servos to neutral and prompted the user to place the device on a bench or neutral position. Then we could utilise the consistent readings to decipher a valid offset to subtract from each reading. This offset was stored in a struct, and applied to all further readings from the device.

#### Best Use
The latter of these modules was entirely in software, and required no user interaction to successfully perform. However, the former required a button input to operate. This was assisted through both serial and LCD prompts, however best use practises are still necessary to prevent system damage. For example, it is impropper to physically adjust the servos. Further, the initialisation of the servos provides the duty cycle required to move them, and an input out of the range of the max/min duty cycle will cause jittery, false servo movement. The following buttons provided the following movement:
```
PH0 -> 1: Move servo right
PH1 -> 1: Move servo left
PH2 -> 1: Store right position
PH3 -> 1: Store left position

PH7 -> 1: Switch axis (right turns to up, left to down)
```


### Module 3 - Logic
The logic module aimed to adjust for gyroscopic motion of the system to create a gimble-like device that remains in a neutral position. It did this through calculations of the rotation through pitch over a certain time period. The module then provided this data to the duty cycle of the servo to counter this motion and remain neutral. 

#### Interfacing

This module consists of five functions which take the following structs, `GyroRaw`, `AccelRaw`, `AccelScaled`, `rotation` and `duty` in the following forms;

```
rotation {
  float pitch;
  float previous_pitch;
}

duty {
  int current;
  float min;
  float max;
  float factor;
}

raw/scaled {
  float z;
  float y;
  float x;
}
```

These structs were utilised in the following modules:

Firstly the I^2C module took data from the system and parsed it through to the various initialised structs.
*I^2C interface*

The Rotation calculations then applied a system of equations to determine the rotation pitch the system had undergone in real time.

---

Finally the servo system calculated the corresponding required servo movement and enacted it on the system.
*Servo Movement*

These structs undergo certain conversions to bring about the intended function of the system through the following functions,

`convertUnits`
Takes the raw acceleration values then transforms them into ones which are a function of gravity. Done by using the constants define in the ADXL345 datasheet, which depend on control register settings.

`GyroRotation`
Intakes the raw gyroscope values, converts them to degrees/second and then performs real-world mathematical displacement equations on them and returns how far the PTU has been displaced as a product of these measurements.

`AccelRotation`
Intakes the current acceleration values in the x, y and z directions then uses trigonometry to return new orientation of the PTU.

`DistCalcs`
Requires the structs which hold information on changes in orientation. Uses these in conjunction and weights them according to inputted variables to calculate the angles which the servos must go to in order to oppose relative motion. Then returns these angles in a `rotation` struct.

`changePitch`
Converts the angles in the `rotation` struct to be in terms of duty cycle which can be assigned to the corresponding PWMDTYXX registers to achieve the module intended function.

### Testing
To properly test the logic of this system the following steps should be implemented:

1. Set up the servo calibration on a table such that it encapsulates the full range of motion
2. Move the HCS12 board around, then return it back to being flush with the surface of the table
3. Check with an accelerometer app, the orientation of the LIDAR, it should read 0,0,1 depending on the orientation of the phone
4. Repeat steps 1-3 however this time limit the range of motion to only include a smaller section of its total capabilities, but ensure that the neutral position is still in the bounds
5. This can be further checked through altering the code to output the included strings, and comparing them against expected values at the natural position
