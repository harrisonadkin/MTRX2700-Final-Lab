### To Do:
#### Alessandro
- [x] servo control
- [x] working calculations model and functions
- [ ] angle to duty cycle function
- [ ] integrate above with calculations function


#### Harrison
- [x] startup serial
- [ ] serial integrated with calibration
- [ ] recalibration function

#### Zach
- [x] idea pitching slides
- [x] offset structs and functions
- [ ] clean up the headers --> there are identical structs used (only need one float x,y,z  struct) --> see calcs_and_servo/sources/rotation.h for formatting (see how there are headers inside the header file so the function can access the structs)
- [ ] max/min servo calibration function

#### Additionals
- [ ] presentation slides
- [ ] integration
